漠视不可能

——Google创始人拉里·佩奇在密歇根大学毕业典礼上的演讲

文/拉里·佩奇

09级的同学，首先我希望大家站起来，向支持你们的亲朋好友挥手致意！展示你们的爱！

今天来到这里我很荣幸。

请等一下。我知道，刚才那句陈词滥调，大家可能在想：每一位毕业典礼的演讲人都会说——很荣幸，但就我而言，的确字真意深，因为我来到这里，要比你们所知的大多数人都更为特别而亲切。我想告诉大家个中缘由。

很久以前，1962年9月，这座校园里有一家名为史蒂文的消费合作社。该合作社有一间厨房，学生志愿者每十年左右来打扫厨房顶。当年有位名叫格洛莉亚的女大学生，爬上了高高的梯子，努力打扫肮脏的天花板，地板上站着一位名叫卡尔的寄宿生，他钦佩地看着这位姑娘，这就是他俩的第一次见面。他俩就是我的父母亲。我想你们会想，我就是厨房“化学实验”的直接成果，就在这里，密歇根大学。我的母亲今天和我们在一起，我们应该去找到他们的相遇之处，并且在天花板上镶嵌一块铭牌，上刻“感谢爸爸、妈妈！”

今天我们全家都来到了密歇根大学：我、我哥、我父母亲。我父亲在密歇根大学获得了三个半学位，他的博士学位是通信科学，因为他们认为计算机只是一时热门，他是44年前获得的。他与我母亲为之作出了巨大牺牲。在抚养我刚出生的哥哥时，他俩经常一分钱掰成两半使。母亲用手敲出了父亲的论文，我戴的这顶天鹅绒帽是我父亲的。这张文凭，和你们即将拿到的一样，是我父亲的。

我的祖父在密歇根弗林特的雪佛兰工厂工作，他是装配线上的一名工人。他曾开车带着他的两个孩子来到这里，并告诉他们：这是你们今后要上的大学。他的两个孩子都是从密歇根大学毕业的，这就是“美国梦”。他的女儿，贝芙丽，今天也和我们在一起。我的祖母经常扛着一个大铁锤，那时工人们静坐罢工用以保护自己。当我小的时候的时候，我就用那个大铁锤在地上砸树桩什么的。现在人们不再需要扛着个笨重的大家伙保护自己了，这很好。但今天万一出了状况，反正我带着它来了。

我父亲后来成为密歇根州立大学的教授，我也是个非常有运气的孩子。教授的生活是非常有弹性的，他有大量的时间培养我，哪里有比在学校培养孩子更好的地方呢？

我想告诉大家的是，我来这里不仅仅是回家看看。我难以表达我来这里的自豪感，与我母亲、我哥哥、我的妻子露西，还有你们大家。我为你们感到骄傲，为你的亲朋好友骄傲，我们都加入了伟大的、大密歇根家庭，我感觉它是我生命的一部分。

我想告诉大家的是，我很清楚你们坐在座椅上，听着一个老家伙废话连篇地做毕业典礼演讲的感受，不要急，我会简短地说。

我有个关于追寻梦想的故事，更准确地说是一个发现梦想成真之路的故事。

你们知道，午夜甜梦中醒来是什么感觉吗？如果床边没有纸笔把梦记下，而第二天一早忘个精光又会怎样吗？

当我23岁的时候，我就做过这么一个梦。我猛地醒来，我想：如果我能把整个互联网下载下来，仅保存着链接……，我抓起一支笔开始写，有时候从梦中醒来是非常重要的。我花了一个午夜的时间描绘了细节，并确信它将所有作为。不久后，我就告诉我的导师，特里·温诺格拉德(Terry Winograd)，要花两周时间下载整个网络，当时他点了点头，其实他完全知道要花更长的时间，但他很睿智，并没有告诉我。年轻人的乐观主义通常不可低估！令人吃惊的是，我没有想过要打造一个搜索引擎。这一概念甚至没有进入我脑海。但后来，我突然想到了更好的给网页排序的方式，以形成真正的搜索引擎，谷歌就这样诞生了。当有伟大的梦想出现时，抓住它。

我在密歇根大学上学时，老师教导我如何梦想成真。我知道这听起来有些滑稽可笑，但我是从一次名为领导力成长的培训项目中得到了启发。该项目的口号就是“漠视不可能”。这个项目激励着我追寻一个疯狂的想法：我想在校园内建造一套个人快速运输系统以代替公交。这是这种解决我们交通问题的未来方式。我直到现在还想着很多有关交通的问题，你不要放任梦想，而要把它当作一种习惯去培育。现在人们花大力气干的很多事情，如做饭、保洁、开车，今后只会占用很少的时间。也就是说，如果我们“漠视不可能”，就能找到解决方案。

我认为，实现雄心勃勃的梦想更为容易，我知道这听起来是一派胡言。既然没有人能疯狂到做这件事情，你也不可能完成。但最优秀的人就希望挑战。这就是谷歌所面临的。我们的使命就是组织全球的信息，并且让它到处能接受，并发挥作用。这难道不会让大家兴奋吗？但是我们真的不想启动谷歌，因为谢林和我都太担心拿不到博士学位。不过我们后来刷爆了三张信用卡，从一辆敞篷货车中买了硬盘，这也是谷歌最早的硬件。如果用一句话总结，如何改变世界，那就是在某种极度兴奋的事业上发奋努力。

当我做博士的时候，我像做三个方面的项目。感谢我的导师，他对我说，“为什么你不做做网络呢？”他给了我一些非常好的建议，因为即使在1995年，网络正随着人们和活动的增长而增长。技术和网络能使你变懒。变懒？我的意思是三人组合写的软件就可以让数以百计的人使用并受益，但三个人可以一天接上百万次电话吗？找到撬起地球的杠杆，你就能变得更懒。

总而言之，我知道这个世界看起来已支离破碎，但这是一个伟大的时代，在你的一生中可以疯狂些，跟随你的好奇心，积极进取。不要放弃你的梦想。世界需要你们。

如果我的父亲能活到今天，我想他最开心的莫过于看到我、露西和我们的孩子在一起。我想他会因为我没能拿到博士学位而恼怒。我的父亲是一位对新事物充满洞悉力和激情的人，如果他活到今天，他一定会有新的想法，如果他今天也能来到这里，将是他一生中最为荣耀的一天之一。

感谢妈妈，感谢露西，感谢你们大家。

### 英文全文

Class of 2009! First I’d like you to get up, wave and cheer your supportive family and friends! Show your love!

It is a great honor for me to be here today.

<p class='justify'>Now wait a second. I know: that’s such a cliché. You’re thinking: every graduation speaker says that – It’s a great honor. But, in my case, it really is so deeply true – being here is more special and more personal for me than most of you know. I’d like to tell you why.</p>

<p class='justify'>A long time ago, in the cold September of 1962, there was a Steven’s co-op at this very university. That co-op had a kitchen with a ceiling that had been cleaned by student volunteers every decade or so. Picture a college girl named Gloria, climbing up high on a ladder, struggling to clean that filthy ceiling. Standing on the floor, a young boarder named Carl was admiring the view. And that’s how they met. They were my parents, so I suppose you could say I’m a direct result of that kitchen chemistry experiment, right here at Michigan. My Mom is here with us today, and we should probably go find the spot and put a plaque up on the ceiling that says: "Thanks Mom and Dad!"</p>

<p class='justify'>Everyone in my family went to school here at Michigan: me, my brother, my Mom and Dad – all of us. My Dad actually got the quantity discount: all three and a half of his degrees are from here. His Ph.D. was in Communication Science because they thought Computers were just a passing fad. He earned it 44 years ago. He and Mom made a big sacrifice for that. They argued at times over pennies, while raising my newborn brother. Mom typed my Dad’s dissertation by hand. This velvet hood I’m wearing, this was my Dad’s. And this diploma, just like the one you’re are about to get, that was my Dad’s. And my underwear, that was… oh never mind.</p>

<p class='justify'>My father’s father worked in the Chevy plant in Flint, Michigan. He was an assembly line worker. He drove his two children here to Ann Arbor, and told them: That is where you’re going to go to college. Both his kids did graduate from Michigan. That was the American dream. His daughter, Beverly, is with us today. My Grandpa used to carry an "Alley Oop" hammer – a heavy iron pipe with a hunk of lead melted on the end. The workers made them during the sit-down strikes to protect themselves. When I was growing up, we used that hammer whenever we needed to pound a stake or something into the ground. It is wonderful that most people don’t need to carry a heavy blunt object for protection anymore. But just in case, I have it here.</p>

<p class='justify'>My Dad became a professor at uh… Michigan State, and I was an incredibly lucky boy. A professor’s life is pretty flexible, and he was able to spend oodles of time raising me. Could there be a better upbringing than university brat?</p>

<p class='justify'>What I’m trying to tell you is that this is WAY more than just a homecoming for me. It’s not easy for me to express how proud I am to be here, with my Mom, my brother and my wife Lucy, and with all of you, at this amazing institution that is responsible for my very existence. I am thrilled for all of you, and I’m thrilled for your families and friends, as all of us join the great, big Michigan family I feel I’ve been a part of all of my life.</p>

<p class='justify'>What I’m also trying to tell you is that I know exactly what it feels like to be sitting in your seat, listening to some old gasbag give a long-winded commencement speech. Don’t worry. I’ll be brief.
I have a story about following dreams. Or maybe more accurately, it’s a story about finding a path to make those dreams real.</p>

<p class='justify'>You know what it’s like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know how, if you don’t have a pencil and pad by the bed to write it down, it will be completely gone the next morning?</p>


<p class='justify'>Well, I had one of those dreams when I was 23. When I suddenly woke up, I was thinking: what if we could download the whole web, and just keep the links and… I grabbed a pen and started writing! Sometimes it is important to wake up and stop dreaming. I spent the middle of that night scribbling out the details and convincing myself it would work. Soon after, I told my advisor, Terry Winograd, it would take a couple of weeks to download the web – he nodded knowingly, fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough to not tell me. The optimism of youth is often underrated! Amazingly, I had no thought of building a search engine. The idea wasn’t even on the radar. But, much later we happened upon a better way of ranking webpages to make a really great search engine, and Google was born. When a really great dream shows up, grab it!</p>

<p class='justify'>When I was here at Michigan, I had actually been taught how to make dreams real! I know it sounds funny, but that is what I learned in a summer camp converted into a training program called Leadershape. Their slogan is to have a "healthy disregard for the impossible". That program encouraged me to pursue a crazy idea at the time: I wanted to build a personal rapid transit system on campus to replace the buses. It was a futuristic way of solving our transportation problem. I still think a lot about transportation – you never loose a dream, it just incubates as a hobby. Many things that people labor hard to do now, like cooking, cleaning, and driving will require much less human time in the future. That is, if we "have a healthy disregard for the impossible" and actually build new solutions.</p>

<p class='justify'>I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. I know that sounds completely nuts. But, since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. There are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name. They all travel as if they are pack dogs and stick to each other like glue. The best people want to work the big challenges. That is what happened with Google. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. How can that not get you excited? But we almost didn’t start Google because my co-founder Sergey and I were too worried about dropping out of our Ph.D. program. You are probably on the right track if you feel like a sidewalk worm during a rainstorm! That is about how we felt after we maxed out three credit cards buying hard disks off the back of a truck. That was the first hardware for Google. Parents and friends: more credit cards always help. What is the one sentence summary of how you change the world? Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting!</p>

<p class='justify'>As a Ph.D. student, I actually had three projects I wanted to work on. Thank goodness my advisor said, "why don’t you work on the web for a while". He gave me some seriously good advice because the web was really growing with people and activity, even in 1995! Technology and especially the internet can really help you be lazy. Lazy? What I mean is a group of three people can write software that millions can use and enjoy. Can three people answer the phone a million times a day? Find the leverage in the world, so you can be more lazy!</p>

<p class='justify'>Overall, I know it seems like the world is crumbling out there, but it is actually a great time in your life to get a little crazy, follow your curiosity, and be ambitious about it. Don’t give up on your dreams. The world needs you all!</p>

So here’s my final story:

<p class='justify'>On a day like today, you might feel exhilarated — like you’ve just been shot out of a cannon at the circus – and even invincible. Don’t ever forget that incredible feeling. But also: always remember that the moments we have with friends and family, the chances we have to do things that might make a big difference in the world, or even to make a small difference to someone you love — all those wonderful chances that life gives us, life also takes away. It can happen fast, and a whole lot sooner than you think.</p>

<p class='justify'>In late March 1996, soon after I had moved to Stanford for grad school, my Dad had difficultly breathing and drove to the hospital. Two months later, he died. And that was it. I was completely devastated. Many years later, after a startup, after falling in love, and after so many of life’s adventures, I found myself thinking about my Dad. Lucy and I were far away in a steaming hot village walking through narrow streets. There were wonderful friendly people everywhere, but it was a desperately poor place – people used the bathroom inside and it flowed out into the open gutter and straight into the river. We touched a boy with a limp leg, the result of paralysis from polio. Lucy and I were in rural India – one of the few places where Polio still exists. Polio is transmitted fecal to oral, usually through filthy water. Well, my Dad had Polio. He went on a trip to Tennessee in the first grade and caught it. He was hospitalized for two months and had to be transported by military DC-3 back home – his first flight. My Dad wrote, "Then, I had to stay in bed for over a year, before I started back to school". That is actually a quote from his fifth grade autobiography. My Dad had difficulty breathing his whole life, and the complications of Polio are what took him from us too soon. He would have been very upset that Polio still persists even though we have a vaccine. He would have been equally upset that back in India we had polio virus on our shoes from walking through the contaminated gutters that spread the disease. We were spreading the virus with every footstep, right under beautiful kids playing everywhere. The world is on the verge of eliminating polio, with 328 people infected so far this year. Let’s get it done soon. Perhaps one of you will do that.</p>

<p class='justify'>My Dad was valedictorian of Flint Mandeville High School 1956 class of about 90 kids. I happened across his graduating speech recently, and it blew me away. 53 years ago at his graduation my Dad said: "…we are entering a changing world, one of automation and employment change where education is an economic necessity. We will have increased periods of time to do as we wish, as our work week and retirement age continue to decline. … We shall take part in, or witness, developments in science, medicine, and industry that we can not dream of today. … It is said that the future of any nation can be determined by the care and preparation given to its youth. If all the youths of America were as fortunate in securing an education as we have been, then the future of the United States would be even more bright than it is today."</p>

<p class='justify'>If my Dad was alive today, the thing I think he would be most happy about is that Lucy and I have a baby in the hopper. I think he would have been annoyed that I hadn’t gotten my Ph.D. yet (thanks, Michigan!). Dad was so full of insights, of excitement about new things, that to this day, I often wonder what he would think about some new development. If he were here today – well, it would be one of the best days of his life. He’d be like a kid in a candy store. For a day, he’d be young again.</p>

<p class='justify'>Many of us are fortunate enough to be here with family. Some of us have dear friends and family to go home to. And who knows, perhaps some of you, like Lucy and I, are dreaming about future families of your own. Just like me, your families brought you here, and you brought them here. Please keep them close and remember: they are what really matters in life.</p>

Thanks, Mom; Thanks, Lucy.

And thank you, all, very much.
